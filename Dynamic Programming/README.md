Interesting dynamic programming problems, optimizations or formulations.

**Problems:**
1. Minimum coins for change ([LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)): (time, space) = (O(nM), O(M)), where n is the number of coins and M is the amount
2. 0-1 knapsack ([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/)): (time, space) = (O(nC), O(C)), where n is the number of items and C is the capacity
