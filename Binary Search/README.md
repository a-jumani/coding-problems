Using variants of binary search to solve problems.

**Problems:**
1. Count of element in sorted array with repetitions: (time, space) = (O(log n), O(1))
2. Painter's Partition Problem:
    - With binary search replacing the linear search subroutine in the DP solution given at [GeeksforGeeks]((https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/painters-partition-problem/)): (time, space) = (O(k n log n), O(n))
    - With different binary search solution from [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/binary-search/):  (time, space) = (O(n log n), O(1))
3. Number of paths to climb stairs ([LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)): (time, space) = (O(log n), O(1))
